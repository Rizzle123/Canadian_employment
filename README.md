# Canadian employment

This study seeks to answer the question, "What influence does oneâ€™s educational qualification have on income among male and female graduates?"

The following are available for review:

1. Dataframes
2. Code used for the study
3. Final pdf report
4. Microsoft PowerPoint presentation

The data was taken from Statistics Canada in 2022 at https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710011401
